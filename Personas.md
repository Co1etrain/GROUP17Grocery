Personas of example users (at different levels) who use the app:

STEP 2:

Who are you? (Employee)
* My name is Gabe and I am a worker at a Grocery Store, working on minimum wage. 

What’s your main goal?
* My main goal is to restock shelves, scan items at checkout, and tend to customer needs. I also want to be able to efficiently update food items in our inventory.

What’s your main barrier to achieving this goal?
* I need to be able to change the prices of items for the customers, and add and remove items from inventory as they go out of stock or we get more supply,   but I have no efficient way to do so without an app.

___________________

Who are you? (Customer)
* I am Emma, a working mother with two young kids. I'm always trying to balance my career and family life. I usually do most of the grocery shopping for my family.

What's your main goal?

* My main goal is to find an efficient way to do my grocery shopping, ensuring that I get all the necessary items for my family without spending too much     time in the store. I want to be able to sort and filter different grocery items based on price and ingredients, since one of my kids has a deadly peanut   allergy, and I must rigorously budget my weeks.

What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?
* My main barrier is my limited time due to my demanding job and taking care of my kids. I struggle to find time to plan meals, make shopping lists, and     visit the grocery store regularly. Due to this lack of time, I am unable to plan my grocery shopping efficiently.

Who are you?  (Store Owner)
* I am John, the grocery store owner. I am responsible for overseeing the daily operations, managing employees, and ensuring customer satisfaction.

What's your main goal?
* My main goal is to efficiently run the store, maximize sales, and provide a pleasant shopping experience for our customers. 
  I want to be able to help the customers find what they need, and make shopping at our store as easy as it can be.
  
What's your main barrier to achieving this goal?
* My main barrier is not having an app to properly manage my store, as I constantly need to import new goods, and manage multiple employees, giving them     proper roles/responsibilities for access in the app. I would also like to better know customers’ needs by viewing their carts and the most popular items   that customers like.
